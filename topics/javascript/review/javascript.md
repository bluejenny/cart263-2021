## JavaScript

- The __language of interactivity__ on the web
- __Incredibly popular__
- Has __countless libraries and extensions available__
- __Not just for the web__

???

- Pretty much every fancy thing you see a web page do is done with JavaScript
- JavaScript is a great learning language because so many people use it for so many tasks. For any question you have, there is likely an answer online. For any genre of program you want to write, there is probably a community online.
- Perhaps most importantly for learning, JavaScript is a modern language with the standard suite of features we expect to see. Your knowledge of JavaScript will allow you to learn other languages much, much more easily.
- JavaScript has been around for a long time and has had many, many libraries and extensions created for it that give you greater power with less work! (More on this later in the course.)
- JavaScript isn't limited to programming for the web. With technologies like [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) you can build your own applications in JavaScript.

## ES6

- JavaScript is under constant development, so there are actually a series of "releases" of the language
- In this class we will mostly be using the most fundamental parts of the language, which have been around "forever", but we will use a couple of features from what is called the ES6 release of JavaScript:
  - We will use `let` to declare variables
  - We will use `const` to declare constants
  - We will use the `class` structure to define classes

- If you're interested in all the other stuff ES6 introduces, do feel free to investigate online - there are many resources - but do be prepared to be a little blown away if you're not already quite familiar with JavaScript
