## That's JavaScript, folks

- There's of course more to the language than what we've reviewed here
- But we've covered the real fundamentals of JavaScript programming (and, not so secretly, most standard programming)
- If anything in here felt weird or unfamiliar, please review it and/or ask for help
- Moving forward, it will more or less be assumed that you understand what we've just seen (though there's always time for questions!)
